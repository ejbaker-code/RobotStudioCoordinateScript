# RobotStudioCoordinateScript
This Python script takes a tab delimited text file of coordinates [x \t y \t z, new line for each coordinate] and outputs a text file with RobotStudio code using MoveL offset from a preset "origin point" to move to each point (starting at the origin, ending at the origin).

The coordinate text files used for the project are included, as are the text files output by the code.

File names, origin point, toolpen names, and workspace names are specific to this project.
